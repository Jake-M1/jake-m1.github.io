                Hello, my name is Jake Mulligan and I am a recent Computer Science graduate from UCI. 
                I have always found computers fascinating, and I am passionate about programming and software design. 
                I have the most experience with Python, but am also proficient with C#, C++, Java, JavaScript/Typescript, HTML, and SQL. 
                I enjoy working on a team and solving complex problems by brainstorming and then coding the solution. 
                This I have experienced in group projects at UCI and school clubs about teamwork and programming together to create a final result. 
                Also, I am a fast learner and enjoy leaning about new technologies that I have not used before.
            </p>
